# Crop_Recommendation_using_ML_streamlit

## Introduction:
Choosing the right crops to plant is a critical decision in agriculture and gardening. Factors such as climate conditions, soil type, and water availability play a crucial role in determining the success of a crop. The Crop Recommendation using ML and Streamlit project aims to simplify this decision-making process by providing users with personalized crop recommendations based on their specific location and input preferences.

The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze input data and make predictions about the most suitable crops for a given area. The predictions are then presented through an interactive and user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.

## Feature:-
1. Location-based Recommendations: The application takes user input for their location or provides an option to detect it automatically. This location data is used to gather relevant climate and soil information.
2. Input Preferences: Users can input their preferences, such as crop type (vegetables, fruits, grains), planting season, and available resources.
3. Machine Learning Model: The project integrates a machine learning model trained on historical crop yield data, soil characteristics, and climate patterns. This model generates crop recommendations based on the user's input.
4. Interactive Interface: The web interface built with Streamlit makes it easy for users to interact with the application. The recommendations are presented in a clear and visually appealing manner.
5. Crop Information: For each recommended crop, users can access information about its growth requirements, potential yield, and care instructions.
6. Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Findings:
1. **Rice** requires *more rainfall* while **Muskmelon** requires *least*.
2. **Cotton** require *more nitrogen* rich soil while **Orange** requires *less potassium* rich soil.
3. **Grapes** can grow in *low temperature* while **Papaya** needs *more temperature*.
4. **Chickpea** is for *less humidity* and **Coconut** for *more*.
5. **Mothbeans** can grow in *basic* and *acidic* ph level.
